People do ask the question, what is mathematics? What is the relationship between mathematics and physics? Well, sometimes Mathematics lead, sometimes physics lead, sometimes they come together because they are complementary of each other. In 17th Century Issac Newton asked the Simple question if an apple falls, does the moon also fall? that was perhaps one of the greatest question ever asked by a member of Homo sapiens since, 5 million years, since we parted away with the apes: if an apple falls, does the moon also fall? Issac Newton said Yes.. The moon falls because of the inverse square law, so does an apple. He had an unified theory of the heavens but he didn't had the mathematics to solve the falling moon problem. So, what did he do? He invented Calculus. So, Calculus is the direct consequence for solving the falling moon problem. Infact, when you encountered Calculus in Physics for the first time, what do you do? You used Calculus to calculate the motion of falling bodies. That's what Newton exactly did. He used Calculus to solve the falling moon problem which opened up the Celestial Mechanics. So,here was a situation that Mathematics and Physics were almost co-joined.

Then, Here comes Einstein asking a different question i.e. what is the nature and origin of Gravity? Einstein said the “Gravity is nothing, but a by product of Curved Space”. Why are you sitting in a chair? 
A normal person would say you are sitting on the chair because Gravity pulls you to the ground, but Einstein said No No No… There is no such thing i.e. a gravitational pull, the earth has curved the space over your head and around your body, so “The space is pushing you into your chair”.
