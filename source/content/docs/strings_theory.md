Hence, the goal of Physics, we believe is to find an equation perhaps not more than one inch long which allow us to unify us all the fundamental forces of nature and allow us to reach the ‘MIND OF GOD'. The key is that There'll be SUPERSYMMETRY in that equation - A symmetry that comes out of PHYSICS NOT the MATHEMATICS and it appallingly shocked the world of mathematics.

But what do we see is that all this is pure mathematics. So,the first resolution could be that THE GOD COULD BE A MATHEMATICIAN.

Mind of the God is “COSMIC MUSIC ,THE MUSIC OF STRINGS RESONATING THROUGH ELEVENTH DIMENSIONAL HYPERSPACE” and that is the mind of the god.

<p>
So,God is a musician. Isn't it?
This is gonna to be an infinite loop.
