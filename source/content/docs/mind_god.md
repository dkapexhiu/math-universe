Einstein summarized that space pushes. So, pushing by space-time fabric requires differential calculus i.e. the language of curved surfaces. Hence, again a situation where mathematics and physics were closely combined. But this time mathematics came first, theory of curved surfaces came first. Einstein took the theory of curved surfaces and imported into our Physics.

Now we have String Theory. It turns out that 100 years ago Mathematics and Physics were parted ways; in fact when Einstein proposed Special Relativity in 1905, there was also a time of birth of Topology. Topology of hyperdimensional objects sphere 10, 11, 12 and 26 whatever dimensions you want. So, Mathematics and Physics were parted into ways. Mathematicians win their Hyperspace and Mathematicians themselves said And finally that an area of mathematics has no physical application whatsoever. Mathematicians pride themselves as being useless.They loved being useless, it is a badge of courage indeed and they said that most useless thing is that theory of differential topology and higher objects.

But String theory exists in 10th and 11th dimensional hyperspace. These dimensions are super i.e. super symmetric. A new kind of numbers that evolved with the advancement, mathematicians are calling it SUPERSTRING THEORY. All of the mathematicians are shocked as the Physics came as new Mathematics.

Super numbers, Super Topology, Super Differential geometry all of us consider a A Super Symmetric Theory coming out of Physics that revolutionizes entire world of Mathematics.
